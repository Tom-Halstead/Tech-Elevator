# Tech-Elevator

Hello, my name is Thomas Halstead. I'm an aspiring developer who currently works at Amazon as a Maintenance Technician. I've loved computers my whole life and have always had a passion for problem solving. This is my introductory README.md for my Tech Elevator course that I'm taking through Amazons career choice. I'm excited to learn all that I can from this amazing opportunity and I can't wait to see where this lifelong journey of programming takes me from day to day!

I've worked on several of my own projects, which can all be found within my Github. I have a proficcient understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript as of right now. I've dabbled minimally with backend languages such as SQL but nowhere near as much as I've experimented with JS. I'm excited to get this course started and to learn all there is to possibly learn!

Thank you for taking the time to read my README.md. I appreciate your willingness and time!
